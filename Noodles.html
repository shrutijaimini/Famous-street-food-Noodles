<h2>History</h2>
<h3><b>Origin</b></h3>


<p>The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE).[2] Noodles made from wheat dough became a prominent food for the people of the Han dynasty.[3] The oldest evidence of noodles was from 4,000 years ago in China.[2] In 2005, a team of archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained 4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site.[4] These noodles were said to resemble lamian, a type of Chinese noodle.[4] Analyzing the husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated with the noodles, they were identified as millet belonging to Panicum miliaceum and Setaria italica.[4] However, other researchers cast doubt that Lajia's noodles were made from specifically millet: it is difficult to make pure millet noodles, it is unclear whether the analyzed residue were directly derived from Lajia's noodles themselves, starch morphology after cooking shows distinctive alterations that does not fit with Lajia's noodles, and it is uncertain whether the starch-like grains from Laijia's noodles are starch as they show some non-starch characteristics.[5]</p>

<h2>Historical variations</h2>

<h4>East Asia</h4>

<p>Wheat noodles in Japan (udon) were adapted from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine">Chinese</a> recipe as early as the 9th century. Innovations continued, such as noodles made with buckwheat (naengmyeon) were developed in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (1392–1897). Ramen noodles, based on southern Chinese noodle dishes from Guangzhou but named after the northern Chinese lamian, became common in Japan by 1900</p></body>
